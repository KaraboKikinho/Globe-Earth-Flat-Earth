# Globe-Earth-Flat-Earth
This repository documents an independent investigation into the physical shape of the Earth.

Rather than taking inherited models at face value, this work re-examines the question from first principles: geometry, optics, navigation, gravity, and observable motion. 
The goal is to derive — not assume — the Earth’s shape through measurable, reproducible reasoning.

This is not about belief or debate — it’s about asking questions, testing claims, and working through the logic step by step.
